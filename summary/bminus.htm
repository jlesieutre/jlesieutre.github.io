<h2>Changes in the base locus</h2>

<p> Here we continue to explore the dependence of the base locus on
the degree and multiplicities of a collection of surfaces at given
points.  Remember two basic observations made on the <a
href="multiplicity.htm">previous page</a>: </p>

<ol class="numberlist">
<li>If <span class="inline">d</span> is increased, the number of
surfaces increases, and the base locus shrinks.</li>
<li>If any of the <span class="inline">m<sub>i</sub></span> are
increased, the number of surfaces decreases, and the base locus
grows.</li>
</ol>

<p> The following diagram illustrates a few cases of this dependence
when there are only two points in space.  Here's what it's showing:
the point <span class="inline">(d,m<sub>1</sub>,m<sub>2</sub>)</span>
is colored red if there are no surfaces at all which satisfy the
conditions, yellow if there are such surfaces, but the collection of
such surfaces has the line between the two points as its base locus
(i.e. any surface with the given degree and multiplicity necessarily
contains the line).  A point is green if the set of surfaces with
given degree and multiplicity has no base locus at all.
</p>

<p> A choice of degrees and multiplicities, corresponding to a point
<span class="inline">(d,m<sub>1</sub>,m<sub>2</sub>)</span>, is called
a <i>divisor</i>.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="images/bs.png" alt="Base loci of surfaces through two given points"/>
</div>

<p> Some of the points illustrated in the diagram are examples we've
considered before:  </p>

<ul class="bulletlist"> 

<li>If <span class="inline">d = 2</span>, <span
class="inline">m<sub>1</sub> = 1</span>, and <span
class="inline">m<sub>2</sub> = 1</span>, we are considering all
quadrics which go through two given points.  There are many such, and
the collection has no base locus. The point is colored green in the
picture. </li>

<li>If <span class="inline">d = 1</span>, <span
class="inline">m<sub>1</sub> = 1</span>, and <span
class="inline">m<sub>2</sub> = 1</span>, this is the collection of
planes through the two points.  It is shaded yellow because the base
locus is the line between the two points.  </li>

<li>If <span class="inline">d = 1</span>, <span
class="inline">m<sub>1</sub> = 1</span>, and <span
class="inline">m<sub>2</sub> = 2</span>, we are asking for a degree
one surface (a plane) which has a point of multiplicity 2, which is
impossible -- a plane never has a point of multiplicity greater than
1.  The corresponding point is colored red.</li>

</ul>

<p> Both of the trends noted above can clearly be seen in the diagram.
Starting with two given multiplicities, say <span
class="inline">m<sub>1</sub> = 1</span>, and <span
class="inline">m<sub>2</sub> = 1</span>, increasing the degree moves
vertically in the diagram.  Starting at a red point (there are no
surfaces of degree 0), we move to a yellow point (the planes through the
two points have base locus the line), and then reach green point (the
collection of quadric surfaces through two points has no base locus).
</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="images/bsc1.png" alt="Base loci of surfaces through two given points"/>
</div>

<p> Similarly, if we start with a given degree and multiplicity at one
point, and then increase the multiplicity at the second point, the
base locus grows, and the points move from green, to yellow, to red.
For example, take <span class="inline">d = 2</span> and <span
class="inline">m<sub>2</sub> = 2</span>.  If <span
class="inline">m<sub>1</sub> = 0</span>, the collection of surfaces
has no base locus.  If <span class="inline">m<sub>1</sub> = 1</span>
or <span class="inline">m<sub>1</sub> = 2</span>, there still exist
such quadric surfaces, but the line between the two points is the the
base locus.  If <span class="inline">m<sub>1</sub> = 3</span>, there
are no such surfaces at all.  </p>

</div>

<br />
<h2>Chambers for the base locus</h2>

<p> It is apparent that the green, yellow, and red points are not
dispersed at random in the diagram: the space is divided into several
regions, and within a given region, all the points have the same
color.  </p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="images/cone.png" alt="Base loci of surfaces through two given points, changing d"/>
</div>

<p> This is a nice picture, but how to interpret it is less clear.
What does it mean that the point with <span class="inline">d =
2</span>, <span class="inline">m<sub>1</sub> = 1</span>, and <span
class="inline">m<sub>2</sub> = 1.5</span> is inside the yellow
chamber?  It doesn't make sense to talk about surfaces with multiplicity
1.5 at a point, since the multiplicity is always an integer.  One approach is
to just consider what happens after multiplying everything by some
integer in order to get a more sensible divisor; the base locus of
<span class="inline">d = 2</span>, <span class="inline">m<sub>1</sub>
= 1</span>, and <span class="inline">m<sub>2</sub> = 1.5</span> should
be regarded as that of <span class="inline">d = 4</span>, <span
class="inline">m<sub>1</sub> = 2</span>, and <span
class="inline">m<sub>2</sub> = 3</span>.  There is a slight
distinction here, which we'll ignore; looking at the base locus of
multiples of a divisor really defines the <i>stable base locus</i>.
</p>

<p> This definition will work as long as it's possible to clear the
denominators of the degree and all the multiplicities.  If the points
have irrational coordinates, even this is not good enough; it's
necessary to first slightly nudge the coefficients to get rational
numbers, and then multiply by some integer to clear the denominators.
There are two ways to go about this: we can either slightly increase
the degree and slightly decrease the multiplicities (making it easier
to find satisfactory surfaces), or decrease the degree and increase
the multiplicity (adding restrictions, and giving a larger base
locus).  These two approaches yield the <i>augmented base locus</i>
and <i>diminished base locus</i> respectively, which will be defined
soon.  </p>

<p> Note that the corresponding picture for surfaces going through
three different points would be more complicated, because there are
more possibilities for the base locus: for some values of the
parameters, the base locus is the line between the first two points;
for others, between the first and the third; for still others, the
second and the third.  It's also possible that the base locus is the
entire plane through the three points.  With more than three points,
there are even more possibilities for the base locus.  </p>

<br />
<h2>The augmented and diminished base loci</h2>

<p> The points which lie on the boundaries between the two different
chambers pose something of an enigma.  Just knowing the base locus of
such a collection of surfaces doesn't tell the whole story: we'd like
to know that, e.g., although a certain point is colored red, nudging
it by even a tiny amount would yield a green point.  To capture this
new information, we name two new properties of a divisor:
</p> <ul class="bulletlist">

<li> The <i>augmented base locus</i> of a divisor is the base locus we
obtain when the divisor is nudged just a little bit in the "negative"
direction: <span class="inline">d</span> is decreased slightly, and
each of the <span class="inline">m<sub>i</sub></span> is increased
slightly.

The augmented base locus contains the familiar base locus: decreasing
<span class="inline">d</span> and increasing each <span
class="inline">m<sub>i</sub></span> means that there are fewer
surfaces which meet all the requirements, and so the base locus is
bigger.  </li>

<li> The <i>diminished base locus</i> of a divisor is the base locus
obtained when the divisor is nudged in the "positive direction": <span
class="inline">d</span> is increased slightly, and each of the <span
class="inline">m<sub>i</sub></span> is decreased slightly.

The diminished base locus is contained in the usual base locus,
because nudging the parameters "positively" means that it's easier for
a surface to satisfy the requirements, so there are more of them and a
smaller base locus.  </li>

</ul>

<p> Usually the augmented base locus and diminished base locus are the
same thing, and they both agree with the regular base locus.  If a
divisor is in the middle of the yellow chamber in the earlier diagram,
then any divisor obtained when the divisor is nudged in some direction
is also in the yellow chamber, and all the nudged divisors have the
same base locus.  </p>

<p>The new information which is remembered by the augmented base locus
and the diminished base locus is useful only for points which are on
the boundaries between two different chambers.  In essence, the
augmented and diminished base locus tell which chambers a point
borders, even though the point itself is contained in only one of
them.  </p>

<p> Unfortunately, the definitions above aren't quite right, because
the behavior of the base loci can be more complicated than our
examples reveal.  When there are at least nine points involved, base
loci of collections of degree <span class="inline">d</span> surfaces
can be extremely complicated: the base locus need not be just a line
or a plane, but can include other curves as well.  In fact, once there
are at least nine points, there are infinitely many different
possibilities for the base locus, and thus infinitely many different
chambers in the corresponding diagram!  </p>

<p> Even worse, it's no longer possible to say what it means to
perturb a divisor by a small amount and see what chamber it lands it.
The chambers can be meet in strange ways, as in the following
schematic: </p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="images/accum.png" alt="Accumulation of chambers"/>
</div>

<p> Here, there are infinitely many chambers, each colored a different
shade of green, which get smaller and smaller and closer and closer
together as they get close to the divisor <span
class="inline">D</span>.  From the perspective of the diminished base
locus, this situation is extremely strange.  The diminished base locus
is supposed to indicate what the base locus is when a divisor is
perturbed slightly.  In the example with two points in space, the
precise perturbation used didn't make any difference. Here, however,
it does: nudging <span class="inline">D</span> to the right in this
diagram will put it in one of the green chambers, but which chamber we
end up in depends very strongly on the amount of the perturbation.
There is no way to make sense of our definition of the diminished base
locus.  </p>

<p> The base loci of the divisors in the above example are equally
surprising.  Moving towards <span class="inline">D</span> into lighter
and lighter green chambers, divisors have more and more complicated
base loci.  In fact, the <span class="inline">n</span><sup>th</sup>
chamber from the left corresponds to divisors whose base locus
consists of about <span class="inline">n</span> different curves.  As
a result, the smaller the perturbation of <span
class="inline">D</span>, the more curves are in the base locus of the
perturbed divisor.  Our amended definition of the diminished base
locus is that it's the combination of all the different base loci
corresponding to the infinitely many chambers near <span
class="inline">D</span>.  The diminished base locus of <span
class="inline">D</span> consists of infinitely many curves!  </p>

<p> The situation illustrated in the diagram really can arise: there
exists a certain divisor <span class="inline">D</span>, appearing when
nine points are in play, for which the diminished base locus contains
infinitely many curves.  Making smaller and smaller perturbations of
<span class="inline">D</span>, we find divisors with more and more
curves in the base locus. </p>
