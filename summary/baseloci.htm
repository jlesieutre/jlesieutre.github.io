<h2>Planes through given points</h2>

<p>
Given any two points in three-dimensional space, there are lots of
planes which pass through both of them:
</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="images/planes.png" alt="Three planes containing a line"/>
</div>

<p> All of these planes have something more in common: they contain
the entire line between the two points.  Any plane which passes
through both of the points necessarily also passes through every other
point on the line between them.  This is not particularly shocking, of
course, but it's the simplest instance of a much more general idea,
the <i>base locus</i> of a collection of surfaces.  For any collection
of surfaces, the base locus of that collection consists of all the
points which are contained in each of the surfaces.  In this case, our
collection is all the planes going through both points, and the base
locus is the line through the two points. </p>

<p> If we only specified one point for the planes to go through, the
collection of planes is much bigger.  Besides the specified point
itself (which we won't count), there aren't any other points that all
of the planes pass through; that is to say, the base locus of the
collection doesn't contain anything at all.  </p>

<p> 
At the other extreme, if we specify three points through which
planes must pass, there's only one satisfactory plane in the first
place: the collection of planes through the points has only a single
item!  Thus we (somewhat vacuously) must regard every point on a plane
as being in the base locus of the collection.
</p>

<p>
Trying to take it further, the collection of all planes through four
points doesn't contain anything at all.  There's no way to find a
plane that goes through all four corners of a pyramid. The base locus
doesn't really make sense here.
<p>

<h2>Quadric surfaces through given points</h2>

<p> The study of the base locus becomes much more interesting when we
consider collections of surfaces other than planes.
Remember that one way to think of a plane in
space is as the set of points <span class="inline">(x,y,z)</span>
which satisfy some relation <span class="inline">ax + by + cz =
d</span>, where <span class="inline">a</span>, <span
class="inline">b</span>, <span class="inline">c</span>, and <span
class="inline">d</span> are numbers (different sets of numbers define
different planes). If we consider more complicated equations, we get
more interesting surfaces.  For example, <span
class="inline">x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> - 1 =
0</span> is satisfied exactly when <span class="inline">(x,y,z)</span>
is at a distance 1 from the point <span class="inline">(0,0,0)</span>,
so the set of solutions is a sphere with radius 1.  A few more
elaborate examples are illustrated below.  </p>

<div>
<table class="center" style="border-spacing: 50px 0px; text-align: center;">
<tr>
<td><span class="inline">x<sup>2</sup> + 2y<sup>2</sup> + 4z<sup>2</sup> - 25 = 0</span></td>
<td><span class="inline">x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> - z<sup>2</sup> - 10 = 0</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="images/quadric1.png" alt="The quadric surface $x^2 + 2y^2 - 4z^2 - 25 = 0$" />
</td>
<td>
<img src="images/quadric2.png" alt="The quadric surface $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 - 10 = 0$" />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="inline">x<sup>2</sup> - y<sup>2</sup> - 3z = 0</span></td>
<td><span class="inline">x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> - z<sup>2</sup> = 0</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="images/quadric3.png" alt="The quadric surface $x^2 + 2y^2 - 4z^2 - 25 = 0$" />
</td>
<td>
<img src="images/mult21.png" alt="The quadric surface $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$" />
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p> While these surfaces don't look too much alike, they are all
defined by fairly simple equations: the only things that appear are
the variables <span class="inline">x</span>, <span
class="inline">y</span> and <span class="inline">z</span>, together
with their squares and the products of any two of them. A surface
which is defined by such an equation (i.e. an equation which may be
written in the form <span class="inline">ax<sup>2</sup> +
by<sup>2</sup> + cz<sup>2</sup> + dxy +exz + fyz + gx + hy + iz +
j = 0</span>) is called a <i>quadric surface</i>.  Exactly what a quadric
looks like depends on the various coefficients, but they are
geometrically the simplest class of surfaces beyond planes. </p>

<p> Just as with planes, we can think about the collection of quadric
surfaces which pass through some specified points. Now the study of
the base locus becomes much more delicate. There are a lot more
quadrics than there are planes - we need to specify ten different
coefficients to define a quadric, vs. only four for a plane.  Simply
asking that a quadric pass through two points isn't very restrictive;
like asking for a plane through a single point, there are so many such
quadrics that the collection has no base locus.  But when we consider
the set of quadrics which pass through some larger number of points,
there are various possibilities for the base locus of the collection,
which take a surprising shape! </p>

<p>
First, let's consider the simple case of specifying five points which
form a regular pentagon in the <span class="inline">xy</span>-plane.  
</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="images/pentagon.png" alt="Five points in a pentagon"/>
</div>

<p> There are many quadrics going through all five points, a handful
of which are shown below.  </p>

<div>
<table class="center" style="border-spacing: 50px 0px;">
<tr>
<td>
<img src="images/quadricpen1.png" alt="Quadric surface through five points, #1" />
</td>
<td>
<img src="images/quadricpen2.png" alt="Quadric surface through five points, #2" />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="images/quadricpen3.png" alt="Quadric surface through five points, #3" />
</td>
<td>
<img src="images/quadricpen4.png" alt="Quadric surface through five points, #4" />
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p> These pictures suggest that the collection of quadric surfaces
going through the five points does indeed have a base locus: each of
them contains not only the five points, but every point on the circle
which goes through the five points.  That circle is the base locus of
the collection.</p>

<p> The base locus can also be understood in terms of the equations
for the surfaces in question.  If the five given points <span
class="inline">(x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>,z<sub>i</sub>)</span> are
all solutions of some equation <span class="inline">f(x,y,z) = 0</span>
(where <span class="inline">f(x,y,z)</span> is a polynomial of degree
2), then every other point on the circle through the five points must
be a solution of this equation as well.</p>

<p> As a second example, suppose we pick eight points in space.  There
 are infinitely many quadrics which go through all eight: </p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<video width="270" height="308" controls>
  <source src="images/eightpt.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="images/eightpt.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="images/eightpt.ogv" type="video/ogg">
</video>
</div>

<p> It's not obvious at first glance, but there are points contained
in all of these quadrics other than the eight that were
specified.  In fact, every surface through the eight points contains
the entire wavy curve illustrated below.  This curve is the base locus
of the collection.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="images/curvepts.png" alt="Base locus through the eight points"/>
</div>

<p>
Watch these surfaces move again, this time with the curve marked.
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<video width="270" height="308" controls>
  <source src="images/quadricpencil.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="images/quadricpencil.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="images/quadricpencil.ogv" type="video/ogg">
</video>
</div>

<p> On the other hand, if we specified just one more point in addition
to these eight (one not already contained in the base locus) there
would be only one quadric surface going through all of them.  The base
locus would then be that entire surface.  If the added point were
contained in the base locus, exactly the same surfaces would still go
through all the points, and the base locus would not change.</p>
