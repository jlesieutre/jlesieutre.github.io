<h2>Singularities: the multiplicity of a surface at a point</h2>

<p>The examples we've seen already suggest that quadric surfaces have
much more interesting geometry than planes do.  For one, there are a
lot more of them, so we can ask them to pass through more elaborate
configurations of points.  There's another new phenomenon which shows
up for quadric surfaces which didn't show up for planes: they aren't
always nice, smooth surfaces.  One example of this is a cone, defined
by the equation <span class="inline">z<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> +
y<sup>2</sup></span>, which pinches off at one point.  Such a point
where the surface is not smooth is called a <i>singularity</i>.</p>


<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="images/mult21.png" alt="The cone $z^2 = x^2 + y^2$"/>
</div>

<p>
More complicated equations can give rise to even more complicated
examples of singularities, a few of which are shown below.  Note that
some of the equations have terms of degree bigger than two, so these
are not quadric surfaces.</p>

<div>
<table class="center" style="border-spacing: 50px 0px;">
<tr>
<td><span class="inline">z<sup>2</sup> - 2x<sup>3</sup> - x<sup>2</sup> - (y - z)<sup>2</sup>/2 = 0</span></td>
<td><span class="inline">x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> - y<sup>2</sup> - z<sup>2</sup> = 0</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="images/mult22.png" alt="The singular surface $z^2 - 2x^3 - x^2 - (y-z)^2/2 = 0$" />
</td>
<td>
<img src="images/mult23.png" alt="The singular surface $x^3 + x^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 0$" />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="inline">x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> - y<sup>2</sup> = 0</span></td>
<td><span class="inline">x<sup>2</sup> - y<sup>3</sup> + z<sup>5</sup> = 0</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="images/mult24.png" alt="The singular surface $x^3 + x^2 - y^2 = 0$" />
</td>
<td>
<img src="images/mult31.png" alt="The singular surface $x^2 - y^3 + z^5 = 0$" />
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p> These illustrate several distinct ways in which a surface can fail
to be smooth at a point.  Some of these surfaces just look like cones,
at least near the singular point.  In one of the others, two sheets of the
surface intersect each other; here the multiplicity is two for any
point contained in this intersection.  In the last example, the
surface is just "pinched" at the singular point. </p>


<p>The <i>multiplicity</i> of a surface at a point is a number which
measures how far surface is from being smooth there.  If the
multiplicity at a point is one, the surface is smooth at the point.
If it's two or more, it isn't, and larger numbers correspond to even
more complicated non-smoothness.  Each of the examples above has
points of multiplicity two on an otherwise smooth surface.</p>


<p>In most cases just looking at a picture doesn't give enough
information to guess the multiplicity.  Instead, the multiplicity of a
singularity is defined using the equation for the surface.  If the
surface has equation <span class="inline">f(x,y,z)=0</span>, the
multiplicity at the point <span class="inline">(0,0,0)</span> is equal
to the smallest degree of any of the terms in <span
class="inline">f</span>.  This is perhaps easiest to define by
examples: </p>

<div>
<table class="center" style="border-spacing: 20px 0px;">
<tr>
<th>Equation</th>
<th>Multiplicity at (0,0,0)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="inline">x + y + z = 0</span></td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="inline">x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> - z<sup>2</sup> = 0</span></td>
<td>2</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><span class="inline">x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>3</sup> - z<sup>4</sup> = 0</span></td>
<td>2</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><span class="inline">xy + y<sup>3</sup> - z<sup>4</sup> = 0</span></td>
<td>2</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><span class="inline">xyz + y<sup>4</sup> - x<sup>2</sup> z<sup>2</sup> = 0</span></td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p> With the multiplicity so defined, we can now consider some
additional families of surfaces.  Instead of merely specifying that a
surface passes through a bunch of given points, we can ask that at
some of those points it has a singularity with some specified
multiplicity.  Below is an animation of the family of surfaces of
degree 3 going through 16 specified points, with multiplicity of at
least 2 at the first of the points (the points aren't shown in the
picture). The point with multiplicity 2 is at the center of the box;
observe that none of the surfaces in question is smooth there.  </p>

</video>
</div>

<p> Much like the previous examples, this family has a base locus
containing more than just the specified points.  Not unexpectedly, it
is a somewhat complicated-looking configuration, shown below: </p>

<h2>Dependence of the base locus on <i>d</i> and <i>m<sub>i</sub></i></h2>

<p> The examples we've encountered indicate the main questions one may
ask about a family of surfaces through specified points.  Given <span
class="inline">n</span> points in space, say <span
class="inline">p<sub>1</sub></span>,...,<span
class="inline">p<sub>n</sub></span>, a degree <span
class="inline">d</span>, and <span class="inline">n</span>
multiplicities <span class="inline">m<sub>1</sub></span>,...,<span
class="inline">m<sub>n</sub></span>: </p>

<ol class="numberlist"> 
<li>Do there exist any surfaces of degree <span
class="inline">d</span>, such that the multiplicity of each surface at
each point <span class="inline">p<sub>i</sub></span> is at least <span
class="inline">m<sub>i</sub></span>?</li> 
<li>How many such surfaces are there?  Finitely many or infinitely many?</li> 
<li>Does the collection of such surfaces have a base
locus? What does it look like?</li> 
</ol>

<p>
Let's collect together the answers to these questions for the various
examples encountered so far.</p>

<p> Ideally, we'd like to be able to quickly calculate the answer to
all of these questions whenever we're handed a degree and list of
multiplicities.  Unfortunately, these questions turn out to be
extremely difficult in practice -- it's not even known for which <span
class="inline">d</span> and <span class="inline">m<sub>i</sub></span>
the answer to the first question is affirmative.  But we can still
make a couple basic observations in the right direction, by thinking
about how the answers change when we vary the numbers <span
class="inline">d</span> and <span class="inline">m<sub>i</sub></span>.
A couple simple points jump out already:</p>

<ol class="numberlist"> 

<li>If <span class="inline">d</span> is increased, the number of
surfaces increases, and the base locus shrinks.</li>

<li>If any of the <span class="inline">m<sub>i</sub></span> are
increased, the number of surfaces decreases, and the base locus
grows.</li>

</ol>

<p> Increasing the degree gives us more freedom to choose a surface.
Through three points, there is only a single plane (<span
class="inline">d = 1</span>), but there are many quadric surfaces
(<span class="inline">d = 2</span>).  Increasing the multiplicity serves
to add more restrictions, and makes it harder to find surfaces.  There
are fewer surfaces, and so more points are contained in all of them,
giving a larger base locus.  </p>
