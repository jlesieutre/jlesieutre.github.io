<p>A <a
href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-24/the-best-and-worst-u-s-places-to-live-car-free">2019
CityLab study</a> ranked State College as the #2 city in the nation for
car-free living based on the very large number of car-free residents. If
you’re moving here and anticipating a tranquil car-free existence,
you’re in for a rude awakening: what the study fails to mention is that
nearly all of those car-free residents are undergraduates living in
dormitories. Living in State College without a car past the age of 22 is
indeed possible, but it takes some dedication and planning.</p>
<p>This page collects some practical advice and basic information about
car-free commuting in the State College area. The advice here is of
course shaped by my own location, commute, tastes, fitness, budget,..
and won’t apply to everyone. There are many parts of town where I don’t
bike often, and I don’t know the best streets. I am often pulling a
toddler in a trailer and may be more traffic-averse than you are. Or
less. If you’d like to share your own advice or correct mine you can
make a pull request at, or just email carfreesc@gmail.com.</p>
<h1 id="the-basics">The basics</h1>
<p>Although State College is relatively compact, it is not quite small
enough that you can get away with walking everywhere. You will need to
rely on buses and biking. Below is a map showing downtown, campus, and
what are to my mind the “major” bike and bus routes (i.e. those that I
use). The darker the color of a route, the more I like it. Dark bus
routes have regular and frequent service throughout the day, while light
ones are designed for commuters and may have only morning and evening
service. Dark bike routes are separated off-road paths, and light ones
or roads I like to ride (with or without bike lanes). There are many
other routes (bus and bike alike) not shown here; you should look at a
map to see what’s in your neighborhood.</p>
<p>The bus network in town is <a href="https://catabus.com/">CATA</a>
(the Centre Area Transit Authority); the <a
href="http://catabus.com/wp-content/uploads/System-Map-Spring-2022.pdf">Spring
2022 service map</a> is here. The buses are better than you would expect
in a city of this size, but the schedules are still not always
convenient depending on what you’re trying to do. All the routes are
to/from campus or downtown, so if you’re trying to get somewhere else
you will probably need a (lengthy) connection.</p>
<p>There are two main types of routes: some “circulator” routes with
fairly direct and relatively frequent service, and some “commuter” lines
that go from a particular neighborhood to downtown or campus, but tend
to be pretty slow since they take indirect routes. A few of the routes
downtown or on campus are subsidized and don’t cost anything; for most
of the others you’ll need tokens, which cost a couple bucks each.</p>
<p>There is also a network of bicycle routes of various kinds. There are
a few nice off-road, fairly long distance routes that connect various
parts of town. However, none of these quite reach downtown. There are a
handful of streets with on-road bicycle lanes in the immediate downtown
area. State College’s greatest bicycling asset, however, is that it’s
just not that big and you can usually find quiet residental streets to
take you where you need to go.</p>
<p>The Centre Region Council of Governments provides <a
href="https://centrecog.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=b9264927503843b1a0c6836b50d99cc0">an
interactive bike map</a> showing both off- and on-road options.
OpenStreetMaps has better coverage of local bike connections than Google
maps. (I don’t know who is responsible, but thank you!) OSM does not
provide routing, but various third-party sites do. I use <a
href="https://maps.openrouteservice.org/">OpenRouteService</a>. The
suggestions are occasionally a little wonky, but the same is true of
Google’s, and at least they’re not tracking you. Google Maps on the
other hand does know the schedules of the CATA buses, and is the better
option for bus routing.</p>
<p>Residential neighborhoods and developments can be found in many
directions. There are three ``inner ring’’ neighborhoods that are easily
walkable to campus: the Highlands (to the south), Holmes-Foster (to the
west), and College Heights (to the north). I suspect going car-free is
easiest if you live in in one of these areas. But they are also more
expensive and louder. Park Forest is a large, mostly residential
neighborhood northwest of downtown. There is a good bike path to campus,
but it may be a couple miles. a variety of other neighborhoods also
offer connections to convenient off-road bike paths, at the cost of
being a little further away.</p>
<p>Much recent development has been along North Atherton Street, to the
northwest side of town. This road is unfortunately a car-centric
hellscape, and <a
href="https://www.statecollege.com/atherton-street-project-cost-soars-past-estimate/">$33,000,000
of recent “upgrades”</a> have left it even more hostile to humans than
it used to be. Your tax dollars at work. It is sometimes possible to
reach destinations on N Atherton either by bus or by biking in on a
cross street.</p>
<h1 id="bike-routes">Bike routes</h1>
<h2 id="off-road">Off-road</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>Orchard Park</strong> bike path runs from near the
high school out to the southwest side of town (Cato Park, Harner Farm,
YMCA,…). It has an easy connection to downtown and campus on Gill
St. </p></li>
<li><p>Several paths go through and around the PSU <strong>golf
courses</strong>. A north/south route along the old Corl St connects the
western edge of downtown to the Tudek/Circleville and Blue Course paths.
Another path follows College Avenue most of the way from campus to Blue
Course, with connections possible to Gill St and others. To the east one
has access to campus, including through the IST bridge to Pollock
Rd.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>South Atherton</strong> bike path goes from around
Atherton/University out to Boalsburg, about five miles. It connects to
downtown via a cut-through to Garner St. It is not the best path,
crossing a lot of turn-offs for businesses and featuring a couple rather
violent curb cuts, but it’s the best option in this direction. You will
see the more hardcore cyclists riding on the road instead, but not
me.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Blue Course</strong> bike path follows Blue Course
Dr, from Radio Park elementary, skirting the western edge of the golf
course, and ending near Orchard Park.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Tudek/Circleville</strong> bikeway runs from Tudek
Park and Radio Park west to Valley Vista (and a bit beyond, with access
to the Scotia gamelands off Sleepy Hollow). At the eastern end, it has
easy connections to both the golf course paths (leading to campus and
downtown) and the blue course path. At the western end, it connects to
the Valley Vista multi-use path, which provides a route north towards
Grays Woods.</p></li>
<li><p>There are two north/south paths on the western side of town, one
along <strong>Valley Vista</strong> and one on
<strong>Circleville</strong>. The path on Valley Vista connects to the
Tudek path and the rest of the network at the intersection with Science
Park. You can get from Valley Vista to the Circleville path by cutting
through Circleville Park; take the turn-off for “Little Lion Drive”
which is Park Forest Middle School. Together, these paths will get you
from downtown all the way to Grays Woods with virtually no riding on a
road. It’s about seven or eight miles.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="roads">Roads</h2>
<p>The most difficult place to navigate on a bike is downtown, where
there are few bike lanes and more traffic. I’ve color-coded this map
according to how much I like various streets.</p>
<p>Let me opine on a few specific roads.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Foster Avenue</strong> is just a block up from Beaver Ave
and is my go-to route for getting places in town: take Foster to the
correct cross street and then head in. (Yes, I live south of downtown.)
It is a designated bike route for (almost) its entire length, although
there is no bike lane except for one small stretch. However, it is not a
through street for cars, which are blocked by Central Parklet and an
island in Atherton St. It is usually pretty quiet traffic-wise, although
party-wise it gets a little rowdy on the weekends through frat
row.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Calder Way</strong> is an alley between Beaver and
College with a lot less traffic than either. However, many businesses
receive their deliveries there and riding can still be a little dicey.
It is also one-way through much of downtown. I think there have been
some rumblings in borough council about bike and pedestrian improvements
to Calder, which would be great, but I am not plugged-in enough to know
what (if anything) is actually going to happen. For now, it’s a fine
option if you just want to go a couple blocks downtown.</p></li>
<li><p>Most cross streets to Beaver and College in the downtown area are
fine to ride on, especially west of Atherton. Some I find especially
convenient depending on how far west I am and which one-ways are the
right way are <strong>Gill</strong>, <strong>Garner</strong>,
<strong>Allen</strong>, <strong>Hetzel</strong>, and
<strong>Locust</strong>. The big roads to avoid are
<strong>Atherton</strong> and <strong>University</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Allen St</strong> is a conundrum. On the downtown side of
Foster, it has no bike lane, but I ride it all the time. Just take the
whole lane if you need to. On the out-of-town side of Foster, it has a
bike lane, but I avoid it: cars often blast down the hill and there’s a
weird intersection at McCormick. I find Pugh a block over to be a bit
more peaceful.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Garner</strong> is my usual route from downtown to parts
south. There is a bike lane most of the way, although unfortunately
coming into town they gave up and you are unceremoniously dumped into
the slightly treacherous intersection with Beaver. You should resist the
temptation to bomb down the hill to Easterly since a) there is a stop
sign at the bottom and b) cars tend to roll the stop signs at the
crosses; I usually take the lane. Note that at end the of the bike lane
you can cut through to S Atherton.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sparks</strong> is a designated bike route for some
reason and has some sharrows, but it’s the busiest north/south street in
this vicinity since it connects College to Westerly. Not much reason to
ride here, go a block over to Gill.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Easterly/Westerly Parkway</strong> is designated as a
bicycle route on the COG map. Again they did slap down some sharrows,
but it’s a narrow road with a lot of traffic. Unfortunately there is not
really another long east-west street at this latitude. Hamilton is
sometimes an option. There is now <a
href="https://www.statecollege.com/three-centre-county-transportation-alternatives-projects-receive-more-than-2-million-in-funding/">$1.1
million funding</a> for an off-road multi-use path along Westerly, so
this should improve in the next few years. (Don’t let this lift your
spirits too much; in comparison, the borough will soon blow $2.55
million on a wholly unnecessary new surface lot(!) on Nittany.)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="campus">Campus</h2>
<p>There are relatively few roads on campus, but most of them are
relatively bikable. In areas without roads, biking on the sidewalks is
permitted as long as you ride like a sane person and yield to
pedestrians. As in all things, there is an official PSU policy with the
details: <a href="https://policy.psu.edu/policies/sy16">SY16 Regulations
for Bicycles / Skateboards / Scooters / In-Line Skates / Roller Skates /
Electric Personal Assistive Mobility Devices</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pollock</strong> cuts east-west across campus (this is
the road in front of the HUB). It has no bike lane, but gates in the
middle mean it is closed to cars for most of the day (except for OPP and
fancy administrators with a permit to park at Old Main). It also
connects to the IST building, a (walk-your-) bikable bridge over
Atherton.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Curtin</strong> is another east-west street, but a lot
busier. It’s rideable, but prefer Pollock when you can.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shortlidge</strong> is the extension of Garner onto
campus. It has a bike lane and is a fine option to go north/south or
connect back into town.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="biking-considerations">Biking considerations</h1>
<p>There are two bicycle shops in town: <strong>Freeze Thaw
Cycles</strong> downtown near College &amp; Allen, and <strong>The
Bicycle Shop</strong> a few blocks to the west at Beaver and Barnard.
Both are excellent, but can also have very long waits, especially at the
beginning of summer. These are not the only options for repairs.
<strong>Blacklist Bicycles</strong> is a mobile repair shop, who I
gather will show up at your house with a van and fix your bikes.
<strong>The Bike Den</strong> is located in a PSU parking garage on the
west end of campus and has a variety of tools and classes available.
There are also a lot of little “bike repair stations” around, in case
you just need an Allen Wrench or a pump.</p>
<p>You are supposed to register your bicycle and put on a little sticker
on the frame; you can do it at any of the bike shops or online. I think
in theory you could be fined if you don’t, but mostly it helps the
police track the bike if it’s stolen. Speaking of which, a good bike
lock is essential.</p>
<p>State College is fairly hilly. If you don’t think you’ll be able to
make it up the hills, you might consider an eBike, or using the “Spin”
eBike sharing program that’s available in many parts of town.</p>
<p>If you’re ever feeling nervous about traffic, you usually have the
option of riding on the sidewalk. In the borough, sidewalk riding is
allowed everywhere except the “downtown business district”, defined in
ordinances as the area shaded below. On campus, sidewalk riding is
allowed outside the “Bicycle Exclusion Zone”, which is bounded by Curtin
to the north and Pollock to the south. You can also just walk your bike
on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>It can get pretty cold here in the winter. If you’re commuting in the
morning, you are looking at a couple months below freezing, and
sometimes a day or two a year where the temperature dips below 0 F.
You’ll want to dress appropriately. I am a convert to <a
href="https://barmitts.com/">Bar Mitts</a>, available at Freeze
Thaw.</p>
<p>Snow is typically cleared pretty quickly and the roads are salted to
the point that they are fine to bike on, but you’ll probably want to
take extra care to avoid ice and traffic after a storm. Most of the
major off-road paths are theoretically cleared in the winter. The
exceptions I am aware of are in the golf course (both the gravel path
parallel to college, and the remains of Corl St) and the path along 322
from Scenery Park towards Lemont. In my experience the other paths are
cleared pretty quickly, but people who actually commute on them might
have better information. I did have a couple very icy trips on S
Atherton in 2022. Sidewalks and roads on campus are reliably cleared
early and quickly.</p>
<p>It gets dark early in the winter. It will be totally dark by the time
of the 5 o’clock trip home. Good bike lights, front and back, are called
for, both by the law and by common sense.</p>
<h1 id="other-transportation">Other transportation</h1>
<h2 id="rental-bikes">Rental bikes</h2>
<p>There is a network of shared eBikes available for rent all over town
and campus, Spin bikes. I have never ridden one, but the service seems
to be very popular and I see the bikes all over the place. I do not know
exactly what area has reliable coverage.</p>
<h2 id="car-rental">Car rental</h2>
<p>It is probably unavoidable: sometimes you need a car. There are
several car rental options not too remote from downtown. If you’re a PSU
employee, you can get outstanding deals on personal car rentals through
<a
href="https://pennstateoffice365.sharepoint.com/sites/NationalEnterpriseCarRentalAgreement">National
and Enterprise using the Big Ten discount</a>. They have a rental office
at College and Blue Course which is a couple miles walking or can be
reached by several bus lines from downtown.</p>
<p>Zipcar in town seems to be defunct and I am not aware of any
alternative carshare.</p>
<h2 id="amtrak">Amtrak</h2>
<p>State College does not have direct train service on Amtrak. The
closest stations are in Lewistown and Tyrone, which are both about 35
minutes from here, but in opposite directions. If you’re traveling west
(to Pittsburgh and beyond), it usually makes sense to catch the train in
Tyrone. If you’re traveling east (Harrisburg or Philadelphia), you can
catch the train in Lewistown. Both of these are served by the Amtrak
<em>Pennsylvanian</em> route and have just a single train per day each
direction; this is expected to go up to two trains daily within the next
couple years, <a
href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2022/06/27/penndot-norfolk-southern-reach-deal-expand-train-service-pittsburgh-harrisburg-western-pennsylvania/stories/202206270059">thanks
to the 2022 infrastructure bill</a>.</p>
<p>You can also buy a ticket directly from State College on amtrak.com.
These tickets involve a “Thru-Way” bus: you board a bus downtown and
then transfer to a train, usually about 90 minutes away in Harrisburg.
Harrisburg has frequent train service (Amtrak owns the track from there
to Philly) and the bus-train transfer is inside the same building, so
this tends to be pretty convenient. Recent cuts to bus service have
greatly reduced the number of schedules available, but it’s still worth
checking.</p>
<h2 id="taxi">Taxi</h2>
<p>Local taxi service unfortunately took a big hit during the pandemic.
The only company still standing is Nittany Express, and they only have a
couple cars running at any given time. I don’t do Uber/Lyft/… but my
impression is that they are viable options.</p>
<h2 id="airport">Airport</h2>
<p>The local airport is University Park (SCE), located about five miles
north of town. Although it is a scenic bike ride to get there, this is
not very practical with luggage. There is no bus service: you will need
to get a taxi or a ride. Nittany Express will let you reserve an airport
shuttle, but you need to book ahead.</p>
<h1 id="specific-destinations">Specific Destinations</h1>
<h2 id="groceries-and-markets">Groceries and Markets</h2>
<p>Grocery shopping presents a bit of a challenge: the bus service is
oriented around getting passengers to/from downtown, but there is no
supermarket there. If you’re hoping to shop by bus the schedules and
connections are likely to be challenging unless you happen to live a
short walk from one of the stores.</p>
<p>My own strategy is to make only infrequent trips to the supermarket
(every three or four weeks) and get fresh items and small shops more
often elsewhere. Your mileage may vary. There are a variety of grocery
options in town.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>McLanahan’s</strong> is a smaller grocery store right
downtown at Beaver and Allen. Locals may perceive it as a student
grocery store and never set foot there. Don’t make this mistake! It has
a nice if somewhat small selection of groceries and is a great place to
pick up a couple items without a full shopping trip.</li>
<li><strong>Target</strong> has a smaller store in town with many useful
things that will save you a trip to the land of big boxes out N
Atherton.</li>
<li><strong>The Cheese Shoppe</strong> sells cheeses and coffee. They
have better cheese than any of the supermarkets.</li>
<li><strong>Gemelli</strong> bakery has good bread.</li>
<li><strong>Way Fruit Farm</strong> from Stormstown is opening a farm
store and cafe in August 2022. This welcome addition should make it
easier to find good produce downtown.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a car-free enthusiast of local foods, do not despair;
there are several ways to get local produce without driving. Sometimes
you have to eat a delivery fee. At these times, reflect on how much
money you are saving by not having a car.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>Downtown Farmers Market</strong> happens on Locust
Lane every Friday spring through fall. In the late summer, it runs on
Tuesday as well. (There also used to be a winter market in the borough
building but it seems to have ended with COVID.) Unfortunately the last
few years the further-away markets have grown bigger than the downtown
one: there is a large market in Boalsburg on Tuesdays (five easy miles
out the South Atherton path, but the bumps are a bit rough on fruit) and
one on North Atherton on Saturdays (car needed).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.centremarkets.com/"><strong>Centre
Markets</strong></a> lets you place an order ahead of the farmers market
and have it delivered. They have a wide range of produce and meat, as
well as prepared foods from local vendors. You can also combine your
order with an order from Nature’s pantry, a natural foods store out E
College that is not a great ride (but will soon be more easily
accessible via the College Ave circulator).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Way Fruit Farm</strong> delivers to town in the summer.
Soon they will open a storefront.</p></li>
<li><p>Several <strong>CSAs</strong> offer weekly delivery of boxes of
produce and dairy that help reduce the number of grocery trips you need;
I use and recommend <a href="https://www.centremarkets.com/">GroundWork
Farms</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vale Woods Farm</strong> offers delivery of milk and
other dairy products</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mark’s Custom Meats</strong> in Howard delivers to State
College a couple times a week.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are some grocery stores with easy bike access. You would be
surprised how much you can fit in a bike trailer or even panniers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Weis Markets</strong> is located on Westerly right next
to the high school. It is accessible via the Orchard Park bike
path.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weis</strong> and <strong>Giant</strong> both have stores
in Hills Plaza, off the South Atherton bike path.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wegman’s</strong>, <strong>Trader Joe’s</strong>, and
<strong>Weis</strong> all have locations in the vicinity of North
Atherton. It is possible to access all of these through Park
Forest.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="medical">Medical</h2>
<p>Doctors and dentists are spread throughout town. There are a few
concentrations of medical offices.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The hospital in town is <strong>Mount Nittany Medical
Center</strong>. It’s a couple miles bike ride, which is doable, but a
portion is on Park Avenue and not very pleasant. My preference is
usually to take the Red Link bus which offers frequent, if slow, service
from campus.</p></li>
<li><p>Geisinger Healthplex State College (a.k.a. <strong>Geisinger
Grays Woods</strong>) is located in the Grays Woods development off I-99
a bit to the northwest of downtown. Fairly frequent bus service is
available on the W route. Although it is a bit far, it is easily bikable
via the Tudek/Circleville + Valley Vista + Circleville paths with only a
short stretch on Scotia Rd at the end.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scenery Park</strong> has a variety of medical
facilities. There is easy access via the South Atherton bike
path.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are doctors and dentists in many other places too. Mount
Nittany has some primary care doctors at a facility on Blue Course,
which has good bike access. There are optometrists and dentists downtown
and in Scenery Park.</p>
<h2 id="entertainment">Entertainment</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>One of the great advantages of living in State College is our
proximity to the woods. Unfortunately, your options are somewhat limited
if you need to bus/bike to the trailhead. There are various connections
to the Scotia gamelands, e.g. at the terminus of the Tudek/Circleville
path. Easy places to get in (which are also busier) are Musser Gap and
Shingletown Gap. (There are of course many other beautiful places to
bike, but the bike part starts to become the trip instead of just the
transit.)</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>State College Spikes</strong> play at Lubrano Park,
which is easily to reach on the Red Link bus, or by biking through
campus.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Penn State football</strong> plays at Beaver Stadium. I
stay as far as possible away from the stadium on game days and have no
advice to offer.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="miscellany">Miscellany</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The easiest hardware store to get to is <strong>Ace
Hardware</strong> in Hills Plaza off South Atherton. Lowe’s and Home
Depot are reachable via the Valley Vista path, though the very end isn’t
great.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meyer Dairy</strong> on South Atherton is a local
landmark. It is not easy to reach despite being across from the bike
path: I think the easiest route is to take Rolling Ridge north, ride
through the KBB parking lot, and then jump a curb and cross a little
grass to get to the dairy.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>DMV</strong> is located in Pleasant Gap, about eight
miles out of town. There are only a couple buses a day, so they will get
you out there, but you will need to wait four hours for the return. It
is possible to bike, but the road is a bit busy as you get closer to
State College. You also have to ride through the grounds of the Rockview
state prison; I have done this a handful of times and never saw any
signage that it’s not allowed, but I wouldn’t swear that it is. For this
one, I recommend driving.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="other-resources">Other resources</h1>
<p>I am not a serious road or mountain cyclist and can’t tell you much
about non-commuter aspects of the local cycling scene. Here are some
links:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>CentreBike</strong> is the main local advocacy
group.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>NMBA</strong> is the mountain bikers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Organized rides</strong> take place all the
time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bellefonte</strong> is the closest other really separate
city. You can take a bus.</p></li>
<li><p>Other nearby cities are difficult to reach without a car. CATA
