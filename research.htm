"Tri-Coble surfaces and their automorphisms". (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01799">arXiv:2003.01799</a>)
<span class="abstract hidden"><a href="#abs" onclick="toggle(this.parentNode)">abstract&plusmn;</a><br>
<span class="showing">
We construct some positive entropy automorphisms of rational surfaces with no periodic curves.  The surfaces in question, which we term <i>tri-Coble surfaces</i>, are blow-ups of the projective plane at 12 points which have contractions down to three different Coble surfaces.  The automorphisms arise as compositions of lifts of Bertini involutions from certain degree 1 weak del Pezzo surfaces.

"Higher arithmetic degrees of dominant rational self-maps", submitted. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11188">arXiv:1906.11188</a>)
<span class="abstract hidden"><a href="#abs" onclick="toggle(this.parentNode)">abstract&plusmn;</a><br>
<span class="showing">
Suppose that <span class="inline">f : X &#8674; X</span> is a dominant rational self-map of a smooth projective variety defined over <span class="inline"><span style="text-decoration: overline"><b>Q</b></span></span>. Kawaguchi and Silverman conjectured that if <span class="inline">P &isin; <span style="text-decoration: overline"><b>Q</b></span></span> is a point with well-defined forward orbit, then the growth rate of the height along the orbit exists, and coincides with the first dynamical degree <span class="inline">&lambda;<sub>1</sub>(f)</span> of <span class="inline">f</span> if the orbit of <span class="inline">P</span> is Zariski dense in <span class="inline">X</span>.<br>
In this note, we extend the Kawaguchi-Silverman conjecture to the setting of orbits of higher-dimensional subvarieties of <span class="inline">X</span>. We begin by defining a set of arithmetic degrees of <span class="inline">f</span>, independent of the choice of cycle, and we then develop the theory of arithmetic degrees in parallel to existing results for dynamical degrees. We formulate several conjectures governing these higher arithmetic degrees, relating them to dynamical degrees.

"Notions of numerical Iitaka dimension do not coincide", to appear in <i>J. Algebraic Geometry</i>. (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10832">arXiv:1904.10832</a>)
<span class="abstract hidden"><a href="#abs" onclick="toggle(this.parentNode)">abstract&plusmn;</a><br>
<span class="showing">
Let <span class="inline">X</span> be a smooth projective variety. The Iitaka dimension of a divisor <span class="inline">D</span> is an important invariant, but it does not only depend on the numerical class of <span class="inline">D</span>. However, there are several definitions of "numerical Iitaka dimension", depending only on the numerical class. In this note, we show that there exists a pseuodoeffective <span class="inline"><b>R</b></span>-divisor for which these invariants take different values. The key is the construction of an example of a pseudoeffective <span class="inline"><b>R</b></span>-divisor <span class="inline">D<sub>+</sub></span> for which <span class="inline">h<sup>0</sup>(X,&lfloor;mD<sub>+</sub>&rfloor;+A)</span> is bounded above and below by multiples of <span class="inline">m<sup>3/2</sup></span> for any sufficiently ample <span class="inline">A</span>.

<span class="abstract hidden"><a href="#abs" onclick="toggle(this.parentNode)">abstract&plusmn;</a><br>
<span class="showing">
Let <span class="inline">f : X &#8674; X</span> be a dominant rational self-map of a smooth projective variety defined over <span class="inline"><span style="text-decoration: overline"><b>Q</b></span></span>. For each point <span class="inline">P &isin; <span style="text-decoration: overline"><b>Q</b></span></span> whose forward <span class="inline">f</span>-orbit is well-defined, Silverman introduced the arithmetic degree <span class="inline">&alpha;<sub>f</sub>(P)</span>, which measures the growth rate of the heights of the points <span class="inline">f<sup>n</sup>(P)</span>. Kawaguchi and Silverman conjectured that <span class="inline">&alpha;<sub>f</sub>(P)</span> is well-defined and that, as <span class="inline">P</span> varies, the set of values obtained by <span class="inline">&alpha;<sub>f</sub>(P)</span> is finite. Based on constructions of Bedford--Kim and McMullen, we give a counterexample to this conjecture when <span class="inline">X = <b>P</b><sup>4</sup></span>.

"Canonical heights on hyper-K&auml;hler varieties and the Kawaguchi&ndash;Silverman conjecture" (with M. Satriano), to appear in <i>Int. Math. Res. Not.</i>. (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07388">arXiv:1802.07388</a>)
<span class="abstract hidden"><a href="#abs" onclick="toggle(this.parentNode)">abstract&plusmn;</a><br>
<span class="showing">
The Kawaguchi&ndash;Silverman conjecture predicts that if <span class="inline">f : X &#8674; X</span> is a dominant rational-self map of a projective variety over <span class="inline"><span style="text-decoration: overline"><b>Q</b></span></span>, and <span class="inline">P</span> is a <span class="inline"><span style="text-decoration: overline"><b>Q</b></span></span>-point of <span class="inline">X</span> with Zariski-dense orbit, then the dynamical and arithmetic degrees of <span class="inline">f</span> coincide: <span class="inline">&lambda;<sub>1</sub>(f)=&alpha;<sub>f</sub>(P)</span>. We prove this conjecture in several higher-dimensional settings, including all endomorphisms of non-uniruled smooth projective threefolds with degree larger than 1, and all endomorphisms of hyper-K&auml;hler varieties in any dimension. In the latter case, we construct a canonical height function associated to any automorphism <span class="inline">f : X &rarr; X</span> of a hyper-K&auml;hler variety defined over <span class="inline"><span style="text-decoration: overline"><b>Q</b></span></span>.

"Dynamical Mordell-Lang and automorphisms of blow-ups" (with D. Litt), <i>Algebraic Geometry</i> 6 (2019), no. 1, 1&ndash;25. (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08216">arXiv:1604.08216</a>)
<span class="abstract hidden"><a href="#abs" onclick="toggle(this.parentNode)">abstract&plusmn;</a><br>
<span class="showing">
We show that if <span class="inline">&phi; : X &rarr; X</span> is an automorphism of a smooth projective variety and <span class="inline">D &subset; X</span> is an irreducible divisor for which the set of <span class="inline">d</span> in <span class="inline">D</span> with <span class="inline">&phi;^n(d)</span> in <span class="inline">D</span> for some nonzero <span class="inline">n</span> is not Zariski dense, then <span class="inline">(X, &phi;)</span> admits an equivariant rational fibration to a curve. As a consequence, we show that certain blowups (e.g. blowups in high codimension) do not alter the finiteness of <span class="inline">Aut(X)</span>, extending results of Bayraktar-Cantat. We also generalize results of Arnol'd on the growth of multiplicities of the intersection of a variety with the iterates of some other variety under an automorphism.<br>
These results follow from a non-reduced analogue of the dynamical Mordell-Lang conjecture. Namely, let <span class="inline">&phi; : X &rarr; X</span> be an &eacute;tale endomorphism of a smooth projective variety <span class="inline">X</span> over a field <span class="inline">k</span> of characteristic zero. We show that if <span class="inline">Y</span> and <span class="inline">Z</span> are two closed subschemes of <span class="inline">X</span>, then the set <span class="inline">A<sub>&phi;</sub>(Y,Z) = {n : &phi;<sup>n</sup>(Y) &subset; Z}</span> is the union of a finite set and finitely many residue classes, whose modulus is bounded in terms of the geometry of <span class="inline">Y</span>.

"Log Fano structures and Cox rings of blow-ups of products of projective spaces" (with J. Park), <i>Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.</i> 145 (2017), no. 10, 4201&ndash;4209. (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07140">arXiv:1604.07140</a>)

<span class="showing">
The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we determine which blow-ups of products of projective spaces at general points are varieties of Fano type, and give boundary divisors making these spaces log Fano pairs. Secondly, we describe generators of the Cox rings of some cases.

"Effective cones of cycles on blow-ups of projective space" (with I. Coskun and J.C. Ottem), <i>Algebra & Number Theory</i> 10-9 (2016). (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04808">arXiv:1603.04808</a>)
<span class="abstract hidden"><a href="#abs" onclick="toggle(this.parentNode)">abstract&plusmn;</a><br>
<span class="showing">
In this paper, we study the cones of higher codimension (pseudo)effective cycles on point blow-ups of projective space. We determine bounds on the number of points for which these cones are generated by the classes of linear cycles, and for which these cones are finitely generated. Surprisingly, we discover that for (very) general points, the higher codimension cones behave better than the cones of divisors. For example, for the blow-up <span class="inline">X<sup>n</sup><sub>r</sub></span> of <span class="inline"><b>P</b><sup>n</sup></span>, <span class="inline">n>4</span>, at <span class="inline">r</span> very general points, the cone of divisors is not finitely generated as soon as <span class="inline">r>n+3</span>, whereas the cone of curves is generated by the classes of lines if <span class="inline">r &leq; 2<sup>n</sup></span>. In fact, if <span class="inline">X<sup>n</sup><sub>r</sub></span> is a Mori Dream Space then all the effective cones of cycles on <span class="inline">X<sup>n</sup><sub>r</sub></span> are finitely generated.

<span class="showing">
In this note we address the following kind of question: let <span class="inline">X</span> be a smooth, irreducible, projective surface and <span class="inline">D</span> a divisor on <span class="inline">X</span> satisfying some sort of positivity hypothesis, then is there some multiple of <span class="inline">D</span> depending only on <span class="inline">X</span> which is effective or movable? We describe some examples, discuss some conjectures and prove some results that suggest that the answer should in general be negative, unless one puts some really strong hypotheses either on <span class="inline">D</span> or on <span class="inline">X</span>.

"Some constraints on positive entropy automorphisms of smooth threefolds", to appear in <i>Ann. Sci. &Eacute;cole Norm. Sup.</i>. (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07834">arXiv:1503.07834</a>)
<span class="abstract hidden"><a href="#abs" onclick="toggle(this.parentNode)">abstract&plusmn;</a><br>
<span class="showing">
Suppose that <span class="inline">X</span> is a smooth, projective threefold over <span class="inline"><b>C</b></span> and that <span class="inline">&phi; : X &rarr; X</span> is an automorphism of positive entropy. We show that one of the following must hold, after replacing <span class="inline">&phi;</span> by an iterate: i) the canonical class of <span class="inline">X</span> is numerically trivial; ii) <span class="inline">&phi;</span> is imprimitive; iii) <span class="inline">&phi;</span> is not dynamically minimal. As a consequence, we show that if a smooth threefold <span class="inline">M</span> does not admit a primitive automorphism of positive entropy, then no variety constructed by a sequence of smooth blow-ups of <span class="inline">M</span> can admit a primitive automorphism of positive entropy. In explaining why the method does not apply to threefolds with terminal singularities, we exhibit a non-uniruled, terminal threefold <span class="inline">X</span> with infinitely many <span class="inline">K<sub>X</sub></span>-negative extremal rays on <span class="inline"><span style="text-decoration: overline">NE</span>(X)</span>.

We point out an example of a projective family <span class="inline">&pi; : X &rarr; S</span>, a <span class="inline">&pi;</span>-pseudoeffective divisor <span class="inline">D</span> on <span class="inline">X</span>, and a subvariety <span class="inline">V &sub; X</span> for which the asymptotic multiplicity <span class="inline">&sigma;<sub>V</sub>(D;X/S)</span> is infinite.

"Curves disjoint from a nef divisor" (with J.C. Ottem), <i>Michigan Math. J.</i> 65 (2016), 321&ndash;332.(<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4467">arXiv:1410.4467</a>)
<span class="abstract hidden"><a href="#abs" onclick="toggle(this.parentNode)">abstract&plusmn;</a><br>
<span class="showing">
On a  projective surface it is well-known that the set of curves orthogonal to a nef line bundle is either finite or uncountable. We show that this dichotomy fails in higher dimension by constructing an effective, nef line bundle on a threefold which is trivial on countably infinitely many curves. This answers a question of Totaro. As a pleasant corollary, we exhibit a quasi-projective variety with only a countably infinite set of complete, positive-dimensional subvarieties.

We exhibit a pseudoeffective <span class="inline"><b>R</b></span>-divisor <span class="inline">D<sub>&infin;</sub></span> on the blow-up of <span class="inline"><b>P</b><sup>3</sup></span> at nine very general points which lies in the closed movable cone and has negative intersections with a set of curves whose union is Zariski dense.
