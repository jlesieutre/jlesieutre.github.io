<p>The aim of these notes is to give the reader a sense of the breadth
of mathematics, beyond the topics usually encountered through calculus.
The notes were developed in connection with a year-long course offered
to students who had recently completed a two-year calculus sequence.
Very roughly, the topics were chosen by looking through the list of
undergraduate courses offered at Penn State – there are several dozen –
and trying to dedicate four or five hours to each major topic. We will
not simply replicate the first week of each undergraduate class:
instead, the goal for each chapter is to define a few basics, and then
quickly get to a representative problem or theorem, without getting too
bogged down in the details. This is not to say that there are no details
here: many of the chapters contain proofs and careful derivations – in
some cases more details than may be advisable – while other chapters are
content with appeals to intuition.</p>
<p>Every chapter of the book includes many exercises for the reader,
along with solutions. I encourage you to think about the problems, at
least for a minute or two. There are also videos accompanying every
lesson. Where possible, I have also included demonstrations written in
the SageMath system. SageMath is essentially Python will added
mathematical functionality, so if you have some programming experience I
encourage you to experiment further!</p>
<p>The audience I had in mind when preparing these notes is advanced
students who have studied calculus, both single- and multi-variable.
However, most of the lessons do not actually require any multivariate
calculus, and many of them require no calculus at all. Some of the
lessons can be read independently of the rest of the notes, but some
depend on the others. The chart on the next page gives a rough idea of
the dependencies.</p>
<p>There are many sources aimed at introducing advanced mathematical
topics to a general audience. Some of these are aimed at readers who
have disliked math in the past, or haven’t looked at it in many years;
these notes assume a strong fluency with precalculus and calculus, and
are probably not the right place to start (but there are many excellent
options; see here). Others introduce a variety of topics from the
frontiers are current research; that’s not the goal here either,
although we occasionally meet unsolved problems. Instead, the aim is to
introduce the main topics from the undergraduate curriculum, while also
providing plenty of opportunities for the reader to experiment and solve
problems from a variety a fields.</p>
<p>Finally, a brief outline of the topics covered here:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Cryptography (Diffie-Hellman key exchange, RSA, El-Gamal Digital
signatures)</li>
<li>Linear algebra with matrices (Linear maps, determinants, the
Fibonacci formula)</li>
<li>Knot theory (Reidemeister moves, knot invariants, Alexander
polynomial)</li>
<li>Counterexamples in real analysis (continuity, nowhere differentiable
functions)</li>
<li>Matrix computations (row reduction, LU decomposition,
applications)</li>
<li>Game theory (game trees, strategic form, Nash equilibrium)</li>
<li>Factorization and primality testing (the Fermat pseudoprime test,
Pollard rho, elliptic curve factorization)</li>
<li>Optimization with calculus (critical points, Lagrange
multipliers)</li>
<li>Numerical optimization (Newton’s method, steepest descent)</li>
<li>Dynamical systems (Bifurcation of the logistic map, Julia sets,
Mandlebrot set)</li>
<li>Inequalities</li>
<li>Abstract linear algebra (vector spaces, inner product spaces,
Fourier series)</li>
<li>Differential equations (first- and second- order linear
equations)</li>
<li>Partial differential equations (the heat and wave equations)</li>
<li>Random walks (recurrence in dimensions 1, 2, and 3, gambler’s
ruin)</li>
<li>Calculus of variations (Euler-Lagrange equation; the brachistochrone
problem)</li>
<li>Elliptic curves (the group law, cryptographic applications)</li>
<li>Topology (homotopy, degree, fixed-point theorems, fundamental group,
Dirac’s belt)</li>
<li>Graph theory (basic facts, Dijkstra’s algorithm)</li>
</ol>
<p>The specific topics and emphases necessarily reveal my own tastes and
biases; I am an algebraist, and the examples chosen undoubtedly skew
algebraic as well. While I’ve attempted to include some topics in
applied math and other areas, this is far from my expertise and the
exposition has suffered as a result.</p>
<p>Finally, I am grateful for feedback from the State College Area High
School students who were subjected to early versions of this class, as
well as to people who facilitated the course: Eric Davy, Mark Levi, and
Jennifer Rand. The compilation of these notes was supported in part by
an NSF CAREER grant.</p>
