<h1 class="title">Computational linear algebra</h1>
</header>
<p>This chapter is a first introduction to linear algebra, from a
computational point of view. The basic problem is this: let’s say we
have a bunch of linear equations in several variables, something
like</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
2x + y - z &amp;= -4 \\
x + 2y + z &amp;= 1 \\
-x + y + z &amp;= 0
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Although you probably could probably solve this directly by
eliminating the variables one by one, it would be a bit of a hassle, and
with many more variables than this it would quickly become prohibitively
complicated. Our first step is to translate the problem into the
language of matrices. This will have two advantages: a) it makes the
bookkeeping easier and b) it makes the problem more amenable to a
general algorithm. In real life, you might want to solve systems of
thousands of equations in thousands of variables, and the algorithm
makes this possible.</p>
<p>The first step is to form a matrix by simply writing the coefficients
from the linear system in a grid. We include the values from the
right-hand-sides of the equations in a final column on the right.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrr|l}
2 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 &amp; -4 \\
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
-1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{array}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>This arrangement is called the <em>augmented matrix</em> for the
linear system.</p>
<p>Now, if you were trying to solve the equation by hand, what would you
do? You’d try to solve for the variables one at a time, by taking one of
the equations and eliminating the other variables from it. For example,
you might try subtracting <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> times
the second equation from the first equation, which would eliminate the
variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> from the first equation.
Doing this (while changing the first equation, but leaving the second
equation in our list unchanged) would yield a new system of
equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
0 -3 y - 3z &amp;= -6 \\
x + 2y + z &amp;= 1 \\
-x + y + z &amp;= 0
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>The corresponding augmented matrix for this new system would be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrr|l}
0 &amp; -3 &amp; -3 &amp; -6 \\
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
-1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{array}\right).
\]</span></p>
<p>What happened? Our simple algebraic maneuvre corresponded to an
equally simple modification to the augmented matrix: we added <span
class="math inline">\(-2\)</span> times the second row to the first
row.</p>
<p>To solve the system of linear equations, we will keep doing something
similar. We apply three “elementary row operations” to our matrix until
it’s reduced to a form where we can see the solution of the system of
equations. Here are the legal operations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Add a multiple of a row to another row.</li>
<li>Multiply a row by a number.</li>
<li>Exchange two rows.</li>
</ol>
<p>These correspond, respectively, to algebraic operations of:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Adding a multiple of one equation to another equation (to eliminate
a variable, perhaps)</li>
<li>Multiplying an equation by a constant.</li>
<li>Re-ordering the equations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s try to solve a whole system of equations this way. We aren’t
really doing anything differently from the method you would use
otherwise, but the matrix format makes it easier to keep track of
everything.</p>
<div class="problem">
<p><strong>Problem: </strong>Solve the following system for <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
2x + y &amp;= 1 \\
-x + y &amp;= 3
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="solution">
<p><strong>Solution: </strong>First, we express the system in augmented
matrix form: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\left(\begin{array}{rr|l}
2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
-1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3
\end{array}\right).
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Now we start doing elementary row operations. The goal is to solve
for the variables one-by-one; let me show you one way to do it. There’s
always more than one way to do these, just like there’s more than one
way to solve it algebraically.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{rr|l}
2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
-1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3
\end{array}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>Add <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> times second row to first
row.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{rr|l}
3 &amp; 0 &amp; -2 \\
-1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3
\end{array}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>Multiply first row by <span class="math inline">\(\frac
13\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{rr|l}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac 23 \\
-1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3
\end{array}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>Add <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> times first equation to
second.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{rr|l}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac 23 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; \frac 73
\end{array}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>You’ll notice that I’ve chosen the row operations to make the left
part of this the <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span>
identity matrix. Why? Well, remember that at each step the augmented
matrix still encodes a system of linear equations; it’s just a shorthand
way to write them. And what equations do we have now? It says</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
1x + 0y &amp;= -\frac 23 \\
0x + 1y &amp;= \frac 73 \\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, we’ve solved the system! The solution is <span
class="math inline">\(x = -\frac 23\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y = \frac 73\)</span>. Of course, you could’ve
solved this directly. The advantage really comes when dealing with
bigger systems, with more variables and more equations.</p>
</div>
<div class="problem">
<p><strong>Problem: </strong>Use row operations to solve the system
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
2x + 4y &amp;= -4, \\
5x + 7y &amp;= 11.
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="solution">
<p><strong>Solution: </strong>We will row reduce the matrix: <span
class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrr}
2 &amp; 4 &amp; -4 \\
5 &amp; 7 &amp; 11
\end{array}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>Dividing row 1 by 2 <span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrr}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; -2 \\
5 &amp; 7 &amp; 11
\end{array}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>Subtracting 5 times row 1 from row 2 <span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrr}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; -2 \\
0 &amp; -3 &amp; 21
\end{array}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>Dividing row 2 by -3 <span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrr}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; -2 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; -7
\end{array}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>Subtracting 2 times row 2 from row 1 <span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrr}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 12 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; -7
\end{array}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>So the solution is <span class="math inline">\(x=12\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y=-7\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="problem">
<p><strong>Problem: </strong>Solve the system of three variables in
three equations: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
x - 3z &amp;= 8 \\
2x + 2y + 9z &amp;= 7 \\
y + 5z &amp;= -2
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="solution">
<p><strong>Solution: </strong>The strategy is still to make the matrix
be the identity matrix, because that will mean we’ve solved the system.
Here’s one approach:</p>
<p>First, we write the system in augmented matrix form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrr|r}

2 &amp; 2 &amp; 9 &amp; 7 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 5 &amp; -2

\]</span></p>
<p>Now we row reduce:</p>
<p>We will row reduce the matrix: <span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrr|r}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; -3 &amp; 8 \\
2 &amp; 2 &amp; 9 &amp; 7 \\

<p>Subtracting 0 times row 2 from row 1 <span class="math display">\[

<p>This line tells us the solution: it’s <span

<p>Here’s a demonstration to automate the process for you. You can
change the matrix in the first line, and running “evaluate” will show
the process of row reduction.</p>

<p>There’s something fishy happening here. The last equation says that
<span class="math inline">\(0=1\)</span>! This is telling us that the
system is “inconsistent”, meaning that there are no solutions. The same
thing would happen if we started with the system <span
class="math inline">\(x+y = 2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x+y
= 3\)</span>: of course there is no way for both of these things to be
satisfied. In the example, the third equation is almost the sum of the
first two, but the right sides don’t match, so there can be no
solution.</p>
<p>There is another reason you might end up not reaching the identity,
which is that your original matrix might not be be square in the first
place. This would happen if you have more variables than equations, or
more equations than variables. Something like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
x + y + z &amp;= 3 \\
2x + 2y +3z  &amp;= 7
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>When you find the augmented matrix and try to row reduce, the best
you can do is this:</p>
<p>We will row reduce the matrix: <span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrrr}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\
2 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 7

<p>Subtracting 2 times row 1 from row 2 <span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrrr}

1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>You can’t really take this any further. What are the corresponding
linear equations? The first row says <span class="math inline">\(x+y =
2\)</span>, and the second says <span
class="math inline">\(z=1\)</span>. There’s not enough information to
find the solution, because there are many solutions! We know <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> has to be one, but beyond that <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> could be any pair of numbers that add
up to <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. One way to think of this
is that <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> could be anything
whatsoever, but once we decide on <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>
we have to use <span class="math inline">\(x = 2-y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we introduce something called “echelon form” and “row reduced
echelon form” (rref). The idea is that once you put an augmented matrix
into rref, no further reductions are possible. You’ve simplified the
equations as much as possible. At that point, you are able to just read
off the solutions from the matrix, even where there are infinitely many
or none at all, as in the examples we’ve just seen.</p>
<p>A matrix is in <em>echelon form</em> if it satisfies: 1. All rows of
all <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>’s are at the bottom of the
matrix; 2. The leading entry (i.e. the first nonzero entry) of each row
is to the right of the leading entry of the row above it. 3. All entries
in a column below the leading entry of any row are <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. It’s in <em>row reduced echelon
form</em> if additionally: 4. The leading entry of any row is a <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>; 5. Each leading <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is the only nonzero thing in its
column.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate both by examples. Here’s a matrix in echelon
form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<p>Row reduction still hasn’t been taken as far as it could be: for
example, we could subtract <span class="math inline">\(\frac 12\)</span>
times the second row from the first to create a <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> above the <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, which would mean one more variable
could be eliminated. Continuing to perform row operations, we might
eventually reach the matrix</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrrrr|r}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{array}\right).
\]</span></p>
<p>Looking at this matrix, you can see that any further row operation is
just going to make the situation worse. We’ve reduced as much as we can.
On the other hand, we can see what all the solutions are just by looking
at the matrix.</p>
<p>What are the corresponding equations? If the variables are called
<span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, then the equations are <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
v + 2w + z &amp;= 3 \\
x + 3z &amp;= 4 \\
y + z &amp;= 2
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>The variables <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> appear in just one equation each. The
can’t be eliminated any further. But the variables <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> could take any values whatsoever. Once
you pick the values of he variables <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and $$, the values of the other
variables are completely determined. We might say that the general
solution of the equation is: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
w &amp;= \text{anything}, \\
z &amp;= \text{anything,}
v &amp;= 3 - 2w - z, \\
x &amp;= 4 - 3z, \\
y &amp;= 2 - z. \\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>This is how it works for any number of equations in any number of
variables. The variables <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> are called <em>free
variables</em>. They can take any value. Once you’ve decided on the
values of the free variables, they determine the values of all the other
variables, which are called <em>pivot variables</em>.</p>
<p>The way you can recognize the free and pivot variables from the
row-reduced matrix is this: the pivot variables correspond to the
columns that contain the leading <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>
of some row. The rest of the variables are free variables. The the
example, the leading <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s are in
columns <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, corresponding to the variables <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. The remaining variables <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> are free.</p>
<p>Let’s try to write it all up as an algorithm, following an example.
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
3x -2y + z &amp;= 7 \\
2x+y-2z &amp;= 3

<p>Solving large linear systems is useful in many contexts. One were it
can be applied mostly directly is in balancing systems of chemical
reactions. Here’s an example:</p>

_ Ba (NO3)2 -&gt; _ Ba3 (PO4)2 + _ NaNO3</p>
