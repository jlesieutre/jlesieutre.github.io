<p>
<b>Textbook (required):</b> K.G. Binmore: <i>Mathematical Analysis, A Straightforward Approach</i>, 2nd ed.  The Penn State University Libraries has purchased complete and permanent access to the <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/core/books/mathematical-analysis/8665AFDCF1F25B1295E6164DEA00FEB4">digital version of this book</a>.  From that page you will be able to download all of the chapters at once, in pdf format.  There are also options to send the files to Kindle, Dropbox, or Google Drive.  You don't have to pay anything (beyond tuition) to access this, but you may choose to purchase a print edition if you prefer.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> Math 230 or 231.  Students who have already taken Math 403 are not eligible to enroll in this course.
</p>

<p>
<b>Course description:</b> This is a course in analysis, which gives a more rigorous underpinning to many of the concepts of calculus that you have studied before.  The main topics will include a brief review of calculus, a study of the properties of real numbers, sequences, infinite series, limits, continuity, and differentiation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Course objectives:</b> After completing the course, students will be able to define, explain, and prove basic theorems about real numbers, sequences, series, and other fundamental concepts of analysis.  They will be able to formulate analytic theorems in precise language and give epsilon-delta proofs of these statements.
</p>

<p>
<b>Grading:</b>
The components of your grade are as follows:<br/>
Homework: 20% (all assignments will receive equal weight)<br/>
Exam 1: 20%<br/>
Exam 2: 20%<br/>
Final: 40%<br/>
</p>

<p>If you like, think of it this way: the two midterm exams and the homework are worth 100 points each, and the final exam is worth 200.  Your final, combined grade is then computed out of 100+100+100+200 = 500.</p>

<p>
The cut-offs are 90% for an A-, 80% for a B-, 70% for a C-.  However, these numbers may be adjusted downward later in the course.
</p>

<p>  
<b>Homework:</b> There will be weekly homework assignments due at the start of class every Wednesday, starting in the second week. I will also pick up homework from my mailbox immediately before the lecture. Homework will be posted the preceding Wednesday, and the assignment will cover material from the previous week's classes.  The lowest homework score will be dropped.  
</p>

<p>
Homework is an essential part of the course, and you should expect to spend a considerable amount of time on each problem set. Solutions should be written in complete sentences. You are encouraged to collaborate with your classmates on the problems, but your submitted write-ups must be your own work.  Solutions will be available on the course website.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exams:</b> We will have two midterm exams and a final.  The midterms will be in-class exams on Friday 2/21 and Friday 4/3.  Make-up exams must be requested in advance of the exam and have a permissible excuse.
</p>

<p>
<b>Schedule of topics:</b> A preliminary schedule for the course is available on the course site.  This schedule will be updated as the course progresses.
</p>

<p>
<b>Academic Integrity Statement:</b> All Penn State policies regarding ethics and honorable behavior apply to this course.
